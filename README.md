# A Basic LaTeX Template

> Average people use Word, others LibreOffice; cool guys use LaTeX.

## What?

Just another LaTeX template I use from time to time.

As seen above, the front page exists in two forms. In "main.tex", you can use `\input{front_full}` or `\input{front_short}` accordingly.

## Why?

TeX is 44 years old, LaTeX 38. I needed a template with more modern visuals, good-enough defaults, and usable in French.

And also, I'm bored. Okay?

## Can I use it?

Sure. The source code is published under the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net) because it is funny.
